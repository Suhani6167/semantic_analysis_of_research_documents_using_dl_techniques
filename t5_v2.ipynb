            " This research investigates the use of Bayesian Network Model (BNM) to estimate the presence of estrous cycle in Japanese dairy cattle. Through the experiment with 280 Japanese anestrus Holstein dairy cows, it is found that the estimation for finding out estrous cycle represents almost 55% accuracy while considering all samples. On the contrary, almost 73% accurate estimation could be achieved while using suspended likelihood in sample datasets. The proposed model has more confidence than the estimation accuracy lies The estrous cycle of cattle is the period from one estrus (heat, phase of sexual receptivity) to the next estrus. For the cow and heifer, this period averages 21 days, with a typical range of 18 to 24 days in length [1, 2, 3, 4]. The estrous cycle is the period from one estrus (heat, phase of sexual receptivity) to the next estrus, with a typical range This study aims to find out the optimum factors to have an estrous cycle of bovine using a Bayesian Network Model (BNM) analysis in Japanese dairy industries. 280 different Japanese Holstein cows observing with their (2.0 to 3.25), postpartum interval, and parity numbers to discover the ideal timing for artificial insemination to make them pregnant. All these 280 samples found anestrus in their farm. The study highlights that, The paper presents a Bayesian network model for identifying estrous cycle using the data sets. The model is designed with the prior and conditional probability of each parameter, and the posterior probability of having estrous cycle or not is determined using the Bayesian equation. The proposed method uses a directed graph, the parent node indicates the cause, and the child node indicates the result. The system finds its accuracy toward the mid-range scores (2.50 to 4.00 This study investigates the estrous cycle in cows by observing 280 individual cows from the dairy farm of Iwate Prefecture, Japan. The study focuses on the postpartum interval, which is the period of temporary infertility known as postpartum anestrus. Usually, cattle do not have estrous cycle during this period, which is known as postpartum anestrus. This research introduces or days after calving parameter The research investigated 280 dairy cows from Iwate Prefecture with the cooperation of Morinaga Dairy Service () Co. Ltd., Japan. The cattle were identified with a unique number in the farm and then observed by an experienced inspector. The required,, Parity number and estrous cycle related data were collected and processed according to the proposed Bayesian Network Model (Fig.3). The 280 individual cattle were found anestrus due to some The learning of Bayesian network includes 270 individual data and the rest of 10 data used for test purpose. The 10 data leave out approach improves the accuracy of the model and 27 individual sets of learning and testing data sets used to validate the proposed model. The Bayesian tree was formed by using the estimation of, and Parity number of each cow. The posterior probability was calculated under these three evidences by following (1). The overall optimum factors for the presence of estrous This research investigated the estimation accuracy of Bayesian network models with higher confidence. The results showed that, when the likelihood is 0.5, the highest average estimation accuracy for the presence of estrous cycle is almost 73% (total 40 cattle) and the lowest is 50% when the likelihood is considering 0.7. However, most of the dairy cows lies within the likelihood of 0.6 (130 + 40 = 170 cattle) and the average estimation accuracy for considering all cattle This research presents the discovering method of cattle’s estrous cycle presence using a new approach of Bayesian network model. The inclusion of body condition parameters, postpartum intervals and parity in the model helped to evaluate more accurate objective estimation of estrous cycle presence in cattle. The results and analysis confirmed that, the more accurate and optimum factors for cattle productivity could be found by the proposed method. The authors believe, the objective estimation definitely boosts up the productivity in this [3] J. Walker, and G.

The study highlights the The paper presents a Bayesian network tree structure for identifying estrous cycle in cattle using the data sets. The proposed Bayesian network model is designed with each parameter’s prior and conditional probability. The proposed method uses the Bayesian equation for each parameter as follows: ( | ) Prior probability of having estrous cycle or not; ( | ) conditional probability of having estrous cycle or not based on information; ( | ) probability of evidence The study investigates the estrous cycle of 280 individual 4.0 cattle of Morinaga Dairy Service Co.

The research introduces as an individual parameter in the proposed, which assists to find more accurate estimation of estrous cycle with sample data. The following table describes and categories the of The research investigated 280 individual Holstein cattle, which were found anestrus due to some health hazards in its own farm. The cattle were identified with a unique number in the Iwate Prefecture with the cooperation of Morinaga Dairy Service () Co. Ltd., Japan. The highest number of parity for each cow is 9 and the lowest is 1. The cattle were observed in accordance with the method of Ferguson [24] and then observed by an The proposed model uses Bayesian network with 270 individual data and the rest of 10 data used for test purpose. The 10 data leave out approach improves the accuracy of the model and 27 individual sets of learning and testing data sets used to validate the model. When the model acquired higher confidence (less entropy value), the estimation accuracy for the presence of estrous cycle lies in between 93 to 100%. The overall highest estimation accuracy for finding estrous cycle based on proposed The research 34 | a ge.thesai.org ( discovered that, the sample data might not be enough to satisfy the proposed Bayesian model. Therefore, the entropy of proposed model’s outputs was calculated to achieve reliable discrimination and use it for discrimination-suspension rule. The entropy is the risk of incorrect discrimination and if entropy exceeds some predefined threshold, the discrimination could be This research presents the discovering method of cattle’s estrous cycle presence using a new approach of Bayesian network model. The inclusion of body condition parameters, postpartum intervals and parity in the model helped to evaluate more accurate objective estimation of estrous cycle presence in cattle. The results show that, when the model gets higher confidence (0.15 entropy>0.15), the accuracy rate lies in between 93% to 100%, which is one of the most [2] J. A. Parish, J. E. Larson, and R. C.

            " The paper addresses the challenge of identifying and classifying genuine user profiles on online social networks (OSNs) as genuine or not genuine categories. The proposed model achieved an average accuracy of 94% in the classification task considering all three datasets. The results indicate that the proposed model achieved an average accuracy of 94% in the classification task considering all three datasets. Future work will focus on improving the classification of genuine user profiles on online social networks (OSNs). Social networking sites have become increasingly popular due to the rapid growth in their use. However, there are some problems with these sites, such as fake profiles and online impersonation. We need an automatic fake profile detection system to make the people using social networking sites feel safe. These are profiles of people or organizations that don’t actually exist or they impersonate other people. The reasons for creating fake profiles can be to obtain personal information and use it for the hacker’s gain. The paper explores the classification of Genuine user profiles in online social media and networks using three datasets: facebook, instagram, and twitter. The study focuses on three algorithms: Random forest, Neural Network, and Deep Neural Networks. For detecting fake profiles and classifying them as genuine or fake, the authors used various algorithms like Support vector machine, neural network, Deep Neural Networks, and Random Forest. The results show that Random forest achieves higher accuracy The paper presents a framework for identifying fake accounts in social networks using Random Forest Classifier. The dataset used by Barracuda Labs has 922 profiles which are used for training and 240 profiles can be used for testing. Linear, Logistic Regression and Medium Gaussian were used. The dataset was downloaded from GitHub repository and the classifiers were selected. Comparison analysis shows that Medium Gaussian has the highest accuracy of 97.6%. The study consists of 3000 unique users with 1500 being fake accounts and remaining 1500 being normal accounts. The dataset used consists of 3000 unique users with 1500 being fake accounts and remaining 1500 being normal accounts. The results obtained from the DeepProfile approach are compared with Bernoulli, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression and which shows that the DeepProfile method gets better accuracy with a smaller loss. An improvement over the previous methods is achieved when the The paper introduces a new machine learning algorithm to detect whether the twitter accounts are genuine or not. The algorithm was compared with Naive Bayes, support vector machines, and neural networks. The proposed algorithm achieved an accuracy of 98% even though it takes less features. The results showed that eighteen out of twenty clones were detected. The work can be extended by considering the tweets using techniques. The experiment used Facebook, Instagram and Twitter datasets from Kaggle. The Instagram dataset has 698 rows of data out of which 120 rows are used for testing. The Facebook dataset has 2820 rows of data out of which twenty percent is used for testing purposes. We used eleven thousand four hundred and twenty tweets from real users and five thousand seven hundred and eighty nine tweets from spam users. The Instagram dataset has 698 rows of data out of which 120 rows are used for The experiment was conducted using the Windows 10 operating system with 4. Dataset in.csv extension was used to upload the.csv files, pre-process and run the model. The dataset used for training and testing consists of 80% of data, 82% of data is used for training and the remaining is used for testing purposes. For the Twitter dataset, 75% of data is used for training and the remaining is used for testing purposes. The results show that Random Forest Random Forest achieves the highest accuracy of 96% for the Instagram dataset compared to other algorithms. For the Twitter dataset, the Random Forest algorithm achieves the highest accuracy of 96%. The Experiment was evaluated using evaluation metrics like recall, precision, accuracy and -score. The Experiment was evaluated using the following formula: Recall.91 0.90 90% 0.90 Neural Network 0.94 0.93 93% 0.93 Random Forest 0.95 0.94 94% 0. This paper proposes a classification model to detect genuine and not genuine users on social media platforms. The paper compares various classification algorithms like, Neural Network and Random Forest on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter datasets. The results show that Random forest achieves the highest accuracy with 95%, while Neural Network achieves the lowest accuracy with 92%. The model can be tested against performance measures other than accuracy and also tested for other datasets. Fig. 5.

Online social networking sites are vital in the lives of people who make use of the internet to do their daily interests. They are platforms that people use to make friends, build social communities, and connect virtually with people who share similar interests. Using machine learning (ML) algorithms to detect fake profiles on social networking sites is crucial for preventing cybercrimes. Fake profiles are profiles of people or organizations that don’t actually exist or they impersonate other people. They can be either created by humans or computers. Some bots are known as Sybil accounts, while others are known as Sybil accounts. The purpose of creating fake profiles is to obtain personal information and use it for the hacker’s gain. The paper explores the use of three different datasets like facebook, instagram and twitter profiles for the classification of Genuine user profiles in online social media and networks. Using Classifiers like Linear, Logistic Regression and Medium Gaussian, the proposed algorithm achieves higher accuracy in all three datasets compared with other algorithms. The dataset was downloaded from GitHub repository to evaluate the proposed algorithm. Comparison analysis shows that Medium Gaussian has the highest accuracy of The paper introduces a DeepProfile deep neural network (DNN) to detect fake accounts in OSNs. The dataset used consists of 3000 unique users with 1500 being fake accounts and remaining 1500 being normal accounts. Gradient boosting was successful in detecting fake accounts due to strict privacy settings. The proposed DeepProfile algorithm is compared with Bernoulli, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression. The results show that the DeepProfile The study evaluated the accuracy of various classifiers using 10-fold cross validation. Random forest obtained 94% accuracy which was operated on 19 features. Twenty three features were required to get an accuracy of ninety one to ninety two percent for the Naive Bayes algorithm. The decision tree algorithm required only ten features to get an accuracy of 98%.

        "   The paper titled \"Japanese Dairy Cattle Productivity Analysis using Bayesian Network Model (BNM)\" explores the application of a Bayesian Network Model to enhance the productivity of dairy cattle in Japan. The study involved 280 Japanese anestrus Holstein dairy cows and aimed to accurately estimate the presence of estrous cycles, achieving an overall accuracy of approximately 55% with the sample data. The model utilized key parameters such as Body Condition Score (BCS), Postpartum Interval (PPI), and parity to evaluate the estrous cycle's presence, revealing that BCS significantly influences other productivity factors.\n",
        "\n",
        "The research findings indicate that when BCS is at 2.5, with a PPI of 91-120 days and parity of 3, the probability of detecting an estrous cycle is 80%. The authors propose that the BNM can be further refined by incorporating additional parameters and validating the model with larger datasets, which would enhance its reliability and applicability in the livestock industry. The study emphasizes the importance of objective estimation methods over subjective ones, suggesting that the BNM could lead to improved productivity in the dairy sector not only in Japan but also in other countries.\n",

The research paper uses historical stock price data of a well-known company listed in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India during the period December 31, 2012 to January 9, 2015. The stock prices are recorded at five minutes time interval during each working day in each week. The proposed models are foural neural networks () and five long- and short The paper addresses the challenge of forecasting future stock prices and stock price movement patterns by proposing a multi-time series regression model based on the gamutal neural network () for predicting financial time series and stock price movements. It highlights the limitations of existing models, which often fail to achieve high accuracy in predicting stock prices. The proposed model is designed on the basis of the gamutal neural network () for predicting financial time series and stock price movements. The This paper presents a novel method for predicting the likelihood of a future event by using time series models. The first category use time series models like autoregressive integrated moving average (AMMA), vector autoregressive integrated moving average (VMMA), and autoregressive distributed lag (DDL).

            " The paper addresses the challenge of detecting fake profiles on online social networks (OSNs) by developing a machine learning model that focuses on identifying genuine users rather than fake categories. The study highlights the importance of online social networks in changing people's views on social life during times of pandemics and global lockdowns. It proposes a machine learning-based approach to identify fake profiles, which are often used by hackers to gain access to sensitive information. The The paper addresses the challenge of detecting genuine user profiles on social networking sites, which have become increasingly popular due to their ease of use. It proposes a model based on Bayesian inference, which aims to identify and classify user profiles as genuine or ws. The proposed model achieved an average of all three datasets. The study highlights the importance of detecting genuine user profiles on social networking sites, which have become increasingly popular due to their ease of use This paper presents a novel approach to the classification of user profiles on social media networks using Random Fores (RfF). RfF is a method that uses random fores to estimate the likelihood of a user being genuine or ws that the proposed model achieved an average all three datasets. The paper emphasizes the importance of Random Fores in online social networks, where users can create personal profiles and share their interests with others. The paper highlights the Social networking sites like Facebook, LinkedIn, Orkut, MySpace, and Twitter are used by millions of people to connect and share personal information. They allow users to share information about themselves with others who are similar to them, such as friends, family, and coworkers.

            "This research explores the use of Bayesian Network Model () for the estimation of the presence of estrous cycle in Japanese dairy cows. Through an experiment with 280 Japanese anestrus Holstein dairy cows, it was found that the model achieved high accuracy in finding out the presence of estrous cycle while using suspended likelihood in sample datasets. The study highlights the advantages of Bayesian Network Model () over subjective methods for finding out the presence of estrous cycle in dairy cows. The research also reveals the optimum factors to find out the presence of estrous cycle among the 270 individual dairy cows. The findings suggest that the Bayesian Network Model () with the inclusion of Body Condition Para. This paper presents a novel method for identifying the presence or absence of estrous cycle in cattle using k Model. The method is based on the assumption that the cow has a normal estrous cycle, which is the period from one estrus (heat, phase of sexual receptivity) to the next estrus. The study evaluates the performance of the k Model with respect to the following parameters: Body Condition Score (BCS), Days after childbirth and/or Postpartum number parity, ovarian characteristics, uterine blood flow, progesterone level, climate, and various species of heifers. The results show that the k Model outperforms This study explores the use of Bayesian network model analysis to detect the presence or absence of an estrous cycle in Holstein cows in Japanese dairy industries. The study involved 280 Holstein cows observing with their (2.0 to 3.25), postpartum interval, and parity numbers. It found that, all these factors influence the timing of artificial insemination to make them pregnant. The findings suggest that, using a Bayesian network model, it is possible to identify the optimal time for artificial insemination based on these factors. The study highlights the importance of understanding the role of these factors in determining the optimal time for artificial insemination and suggests future research directions to refine The paper presents a Bayesian network model designed to identify the estrous cycle in cattle using data from the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHNS). The proposed method uses three types of information: ()/Days after childbirth, Parity number, and Estrous cycle. The results show that the Bayesian network model is more accurate in finding the estrous cycle in relationships with, Postpartum interval, and number of parity. The study highlights the importance of body condition scoring in identifying the estrous cycle, which is the most influential factor in making farm management decisions and most influential for the farm nutritionist. This research focuses on the estimation of estrous cycle in 280 individual 4.0 cattle of Morinaga Dairy Service Co., Ltd., Japan under cooperation with Iwate Prefecture, Japan. The method (0.25 increase) has good repeatability across 4.0 and within observers, including simplified body scoring and have higher value as diagnostic tests. The process represents the observer’s view into the certain anatomical sites for each cow’s pelvic, loin areas, pin and hook bones, and etc. The study highlights the importance of estimating estrous cycle during postpartum anestrus, which is the duration from calving to the subsequent conception interval. The study highlights the importance of This research proposes a Bayesian Network Model to evaluate the finding of estrous cycle while considering, and Parity number. To evaluate the finding of estrous cycle while considering, and Parity number, this research proposed a unique Bayesian Network Model (Fig.3). Each individual cattle is identified with a unique number in the farm and then observed by an experienced inspector. The required, Parity number, and estrous cycle related data were collected and processed according to the proposed model. The interval was 4.0 categorized into 9 groups (Table and ). The model was trained using the Bayonet 6 software, which was developed by Institute Inc. 33 | a ge.thesai. The This paper presents a Bayesian network-based approach for finding the presence of estrous cycle in cattle. The proposed model is based on the estimation of, and Parity number of each cow. The optimal factors for finding the presence of estrous cycle according to, 1 to 4 groups, and Parity number of each cow are, 31-60 days, 91-120 days, and Parity 1 to 4. The results show that the proposed model has the highest estimation accuracy of 93%, while the average accuracy for all data set is almost 55% and the log-likelihood is more than 0.7. The study highlights the benefits of using Bayesian network for finding the presence of estrous cycle in cattle This study investigates the estimation accuracy of the presence of estrous cycle in dairy cattle. It finds that, when the likelihood is 0.5, the highest average estimation accuracy for the presence of estrous cycle is almost 73% (total 40 cattle) and lowest is 50% when the likelihood is considering 0.7. However, when the likelihood is 0.6, most of the dairy cows lies within the likelihood of 0.6 (130 + 40 = 170 cattle) and the average estimation accuracy for considering all cattle is 55%. The research concludes that, when the likelihood is 0.6, most of the dairy cows lies within the likelihood of 0.6 (130 + 40 =170 cattle) and the average estimation accuracy for considering This paper presents a novel method for estimating the presence of estrous cycle in cattle using a Bayesian network model. The study involved 35 cattle from a farm in Missouri, USA, and used a high confidence model to estimate the presence of estrous cycle with respect to body condition parameters, postpartum intervals, and parity. The results showed that the Bayesian network model was more accurate and reliable than traditional methods in finding the most optimal conditions for each individual cattle. The study highlights the effectiveness of this method in identifying the most optimal conditions for each individual cattle to have estrous cycle on due course. The study highlights the effectiveness of this method in identifying the most optimal conditions for each individual cattle This study investigates the impact of ovulatory follicle diameter and progesterone on the productivity of livestock industry in Japan and other countries. The authors propose a method to estimate the presence or absence of estrous cycle concentration in cattle by using ovulatory follicle diameter and progesterone parameters. The method aims to improve livestock productivity by identifying the presence or absence of estrous cycle in cattle. The study highlights the need for further research to validate this method at industry level. The authors suggest that future work should focus on using other parameters of cattle for finding out the presence or absence of estrous cycle. This paper presents a novel method for identifying the presence or absence of an estrous cycle in cattle using k Model. The study evaluates the performance of the k Model with respect to the following parameters: Body Condition Score (BCS), Days after childbirth and or Postpartum, Ovarian Blood Flow (OBF), and Progesterone Level (PL).
